	desc = "The Three Sisters are oft viewed as the parents of science, champions of change, and were once contested as Gods of Chaos... but in the crucible of the Dusk War, \
			all divines showed their merit, and Change was embraced as a necessity, just as much as it was an inevitability. Among them are Tamari, the Mother of Earth; Nunos, \
			the Herald of Fire; and Kasmidian, the Arcane Mistress."
