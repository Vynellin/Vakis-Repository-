Welcome back to Solaris Ridge!
What a week, huh? -- What do you mean it's tuesday?!

Playtime Tracking has been re-enabled; pending further usage. The initial month's worth of uptime was not backdated.
THE SKELETON ARMY APPEARS... Necromancers have been fixed up quite substantially.
Becoming a deadite no longer makes you non-organic. Or non-synthetic. Or just non anything, really.
Clocks no longer incorrectly refer to days of the week that are not real, and cannot hurt you.
Another new dungeon has been added to the map! Surely, nothing nefarious lurks inside...
It would be really funny if you aerosolized the fixed-up stamina potions.
QUARTZ RINGS ARE NO LONGER INVISIBLE...

Have fun!
