Welcome back to Solaris Ridge!

You can no longer teleport to the backrooms by being summoned to the keep.
Merchants & Tailors have more to play with!
Quite a LOT of Dun World has been tweaked and remapped. Go out and explore!
You should more reliably be able to use lensdump for your headshot.
More magic rebalancing!
YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE YOUR SIZE NOW!!
Unleash your inner Kobold; traps and triggers are here for you to mess with! ...What do you mean the wrench is a reskinned ss13 multitool?
THE AREA JUMBLE UNLEASHETH. You'll notice jumping around as a ghost is a lot easier; amongst a handful of other benefits! Like doors being named! Holy shit!
Some stuff with inventory size and reagent capacity has been tweaked.
Repairing now longer damages items at a low skill level.
WILD MAGIC. GET SILLY.
You can jump out of - and through - windows now!
Speaking of jumping - NPC AI has been drastically enhanced and rewritten. You should be afraid.
Some random QOL stuff.
Kasmidian Beacons now act as a nexus for explorers.
New armors!
Bronze arms now get a hidden blade! Get silly!
Resprites; resprites, resprites!

Have fun!
