Welcome back to Solaris!
The job reshuffle is (currently being) tested! Come muck about, see all that's new!
As a result of the job reshuffling, the town has been massively shifted around! Peek around, have fun, and get silly.
With Varielle's description completed, all in-game god lore is finished!
Food has been expanded again! The inn's going to be eating well...

Have fun!
