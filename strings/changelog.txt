Welcome back to Solaris Ridge!

We're testing the first rounds of our newer tileset! Visibility should be drastically upped, no matter where you go.
The ENTIRE game's HTML/CSS skin has been revamped in this vain as well. THe actual HUD has remained untouched so far.
These are the 'monster' changes for the time being, the big ones.
Nearly every spell in the game now has some form of feedback for casting.

Have fun!
