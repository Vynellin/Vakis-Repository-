Welcome back to Solaris Ridge!

Gee, Bill, how come Solaris let you have TWO magic reworks? A quick breakdown:
All the magic updates we missed out on from Azure Peak have been backported.
Fatigue-Based XP Grinding has been reworked!
The SCOM requires some familiarity with magic to craft.
Spell point's exact allocation have been shifted about the town a bit!
Arcane Potential was reworked... Again! Again!
Master-Level Arcanists can entrust their knowledge to a pupil... or two. Or three.
Staffs now drop their components upon destruction. Don't get any funny ideas about how to use this...
Adventurer Clerics & Mages were let into the Adventurer's Guild following a lawsuit. Quoting the Archmagister, "POWER WORD: CEDE".
Adventurer Clerics were therein buffed significantly WRT their magics.
The Alchemist jobrole in the Mage's University has been disabled for the moment.

Asides from Magic:
Deacons & Iconoclasts now get Psycrosses, oopsies.
Cooking has been expANDED AGAIN?!
I loved it when the alchemical mortar went "it's mortarin' time" and mortar'd all over the place with the flour and whatnot
One (1) orc skintone has been recolored
A new issue with wildshape was solemnly added to Fuckup Of The Year 2025.
Templar and Acolyte Tamarites were buffed.
The default laws of the land have been rewritten to be feasible in-setting.
Don't get any funny ideas with the new mess kit, Alchemists... oh; wait.

Have fun!
