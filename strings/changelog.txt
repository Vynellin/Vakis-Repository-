Welcome back to Solaris Ridge!

Your... pintle, should you have one. Should look slightly more refined. If you can be after saying the word 'Pintle', anyways. Pintle.
The 'People I Know' menu now displays remembered species.
Salted fish now have sprites! Oops.
A significant expansion to drinks and brewing has been merged!
Characters with low strength can no longer immediately slip out of nets.
The keep is no longer AA. How did I miss that?!
Doors now rely on mapping access helpers for their lockid!
Deathsight and Signal Horns should be slightly more specific, if not cryptic.
Constructs can now play any job!
Mappers are getting whimsical with new tree-based turfs to play with.
Gunsmithing has become significantly more proficient - and less expensive - QOL-wise.
And, finally - one of the dungeons has been moved, made harder, and redesigned. I see you.
